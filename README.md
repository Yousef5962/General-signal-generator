# General-signal-generator


## Overview
This project provides a simple **MATLAB GUI** designed for generating and visualizing various types of signals over specified time intervals.  
Users can easily create and customize **DC**, **Ramp**, **Exponential**, and **Sinusoidal** signal segments with different parameters such as amplitude, slope, frequency, and duration.

## Features
- Generate multiple types of signals:
  - **DC Signals** (Constant value over time)
  - **Ramp Signals** (Linear increase or decrease)
  - **Exponential Signals** (Exponential growth or decay)
  - **Sinusoidal Signals** (Sine waves with adjustable frequency and amplitude)
  - **General Order Poly** (General Order Poly with power and amplitudes and intercept)
- Customizable parameters for each signal type.
- Real-time plotting of the generated signal.
- Easy-to-use graphical interface (no coding required).
- Save or export the generated signals for further analysis.

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the main file (usually named `Project_1.m` or `Signal_Generator_GUI.m`).
4. Use the GUI to select the signal type, input the required parameters, and generate the waveform.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (tested on R2021a and above)
- Signal Processing Toolbox (optional for extended features)



## Future Improvements
- Add support for combined signals (multiple types in one plot).
- Allow exporting generated signals as `.mat` or `.csv` files.
- Extend to support more complex signals (e.g., Square, Triangular).

## Screenshots
*(Optional: Add screenshots of the GUI interface and example plots here.)*
